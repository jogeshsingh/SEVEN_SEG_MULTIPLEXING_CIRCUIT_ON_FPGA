# SEVEN_SEG_MULTIPLEXING_CIRCUIT
The above repository includes basic conversion of hex to seven segment display on FPGA . It includes 16 switches(4-bit each for representing 1 hex character) and 4  segment displays .The whole design was carried out in Xilinx VIVADO using VERILOG HDL and mapped and implemented the same on FPGA Fabric (NEXYS 4 ARTIX-7 Board)
